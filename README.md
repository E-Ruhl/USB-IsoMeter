# USB-IsoMeter

The goal of this project is to develop a USB isolator that can power and transmit date through usb from one device to another while offering protection and power monitoring of the output port, displaying Voltage and Current as well as providing Power and energy metering. Basically the designe will be intended to protect a more expensive control/coding device from a potentially janky test device with the added benifit of providing some generic data read outs for said test device. 

This project was originally inspiered by the work of Oliver, who's work I will attempt to link here later.
